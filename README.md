# GliaTrace-toolkits
Here is the source code of GliaTrace, a tool for 3D segmentation and reconstruction of cells written in MATLAB.

Please cite our papers below if you use the code for the cell reconstruction: 

- 'Automated training of microglia using multilevel thresholding and minimum spanning trees', IEEE EMBC, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7590922
- 'Segmentation, Tracing, and Quantification of Microglial Cells from 3D Image Stacks', by Mahmoud Abdolhoseini, et al. Scientific Reports.

Please cite our paper below if you use the code for the cell segmentation: 
- 'Segmentation of Heavily Clustered Nuclei from Histopathological Images', by Mahmoud Abdolhoseini, et al. Scientific Reports.

To run the code:

Open the file GliaTrace, change the parameters as desired, then execute the command [cellinfo; imarray] = GliaTrace, and select the image that you wish to reconstruct. The results will be visualized and stored in 'results' folder in the same directory. For a complete instruction on the GliaTrace toolkit, please see the GliaTrace documentation.
